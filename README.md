Case Study: Financial Planning for Michael and Sarah 
Date: January 1, 2024 
Michael (31) and   Sarah (34) are a married   couple   living   in   Ontario,   Canada, with   one   child,   a   daughter named Emma, who is currently 5 years old. Both are planning   for their   financial   future,   hoping to buy   a   home in four years.   Sarah works full-time as a marketing manager for a private   firm,   while   Michael   is self-employed as a software engineer and earns   income   by   working   on   various   contracts.   Their   combined   annual gross income is $120,000, with   Sarah earning $65,000   annually   and Michael   earning   $55,000. 
Both are concerned about their current financial standing, housing   goals,   and   insurance   coverage.
Sarah contributes to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employment   Insurance   (EI), paying   $3,166 annually for CPP and $889 annually for   EI.   She pays   $6,800   in   federal taxes   and   $3,550   in   provincial taxes. Michael's self-employment status brings added complexity to their financial   situation, as   he   must manage his own taxes and CPP contributions, in addition to having no   access to   employer-provided benefits such as disability insurance or pensions. Michael is responsible   for his   own   CPP   contributions, paying both the employer and employee portions, which amounts to $6,332 per year. He   does not pay   into   EI because he is self-employed. Michael pays $4,900 in federal and   $2,500   in provincial   taxes. 
Michael and   Sarah rent a   small apartment for   $3,500 per month.   Their monthly   expenses   include   $850   on   groceries, $300 on utilities and internet, $550 on transportation   (covering   gas,   public   transit,   and   car insurance), and $400 on entertainment and dining   out. Additionally, they pay   $250 per month   for   auto insurance. Michael has a student loan balance of   $19,000, for which he pays   $300 monthly, with   six years   left on the loan. As both are working, childcare costs are   $1,000 per month   due   to nanny/kindergarten expenses. Each   of   them   contributes   $250 per   month   to   their   joint   savings   account.   They   always   pay   off their credit card balances in full and only use credit   cards   for   convenience, with   the   option to   stop using   them   if   desired. 
They have $5,000 in a   joint savings account   and   $1,000   each in   individual   chec代 写F24 ADMS 3541 Case Study Analysis AssignmentWeb

While   Sarah   does   not   currently   have   a   TFSA,   she has $5,000 in non-registered investment account entirely   in mutual   funds.   Sarah   contributed to her employer-sponsored RRSP, which has a current balance of   $15,000 invested in mutual   funds. Her employer matches her contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to   10% of   her previous year's earnings. Michael,      who is self-employed, has accumulated $12,000 in his RRSP, with   a   50%   allocation   in mutual   funds   and         50% in stocks. They   jointly own a car   (2018 Honda   CR-V)   valued   at   $10,000, which they plan   to keep   for   a few more years before replacing it; there is no outstanding auto loan   on the   car. 
Sarah and Michael are both non-smokers in average health.   Sarah receives basic group life insurance   and      disability insurance through her employer. Her life insurance covers one year   of   her   salary   in the   event   of her death and disability insurance covers up to $4,500 per month, with   a   120-day   elimination period.
Michael, being self-employed, has no life or disability insurance coverage.
If   either Michael or Sarah were to pass away, their household expenses would be   significantly   impacted.   The following changes in expenses would   occur:
•             Groceries   and   transportation   expenses   would   be   reduced   by   30%.
•             Entertainment   expenses   would   be   reduced   by   40%.
•             Monthly   savings   would   be   eliminated   entirely.
•             Childcare expenses would be as follows in today’s   dollars:
o    From now until age   17:   $12,000   annually
o    Ages   18-21:   $20,000 annually
o    After   age 22:   eliminated
•             Other   expenses   would   remain   the   same   in   today’s   dollars.
Michael and   Sarah aim to purchase their first home within the   next four years.   They   already have   a specific property in mind, which is currently valued at $725,000. To   qualify   for   a   conventional mortgage,   they plan to make a 20% down payment. For the remaining balance, they anticipate a mortgage with a 6.25% annual interest rate (compounded semi-annually), a 20-year   amortization period, and   a   5-year term. They estimate annual property taxes at approximately $6,000   and monthly   heating   costs   around $120. With property prices expected to increase at an annual rate of   3%, they recognize the   importance   of timely action. 
Michael and   Sarah plan to use the funds currently in Michael’s TFSA and   Sarah’s non-registered investment account toward their down payment. Over the next four years, Michael will contribute   $7,000   annually to his TFSA, and Sarah will add $17,000   each year   to her   non-registered   investment   account, with both contributions made at the end of   each year. Additionally,   Sarah’s parents have offered $50,000   to support their down payment, which will be deposited into   Sarah’s non-registered investment   account         one year from today.
Assumptions: 
•             Their costs (including anticipated property tax and heating) and wages   (both   gross   income      take-home   pay) will   increase   at   an   inflation   rate   of   2.5%.
•             Any   of   their   investments   will   earn   a   before-tax   rate   of   return   of   6% p.a. or   after-tax   rate   of   return of   4% p.a.
Required: 
1.       Prepare a combined balance   sheet   and monthly   cash   flow   statement   for   Michael   and   Sarah.
Create a balance sheet showing their assets and   liabilities,   and   a   cash   flow   statement   detailing   their income and expenses.
2.       Calculate the liquidity ratio, asset-to-debt   ratio,   debt payments-to-net   income ratio,   consumer   debt ratio, and investment assets-to-total assets ratio.
Explain what these ratios mean for Michael and Sarah in everyday   language.   Identify   if   these   ratios indicate any areas of   concern and explain why   or why not.
3.       Calculate whether Michael   and   Sarah   will   have   saved   enough   for   a   down   payment   on   a   house   in   four years based on their current plan.
4.       Analyze their mortgage   eligibility under the   stress test.Explain how the stress test will affect their eligibility for a   mortgage. Use   the   TDS   (Total   Debt   Service) ratio of   44% to evaluate whether Michael and Sarah can   comfortably   afford   the target   amount   of   mortgage.
5.       The TFSA is not the   only   option   for   funding   the   down payment.   They   could   access   funds   in their   RRSP through the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP), and they can also utilize the   First   Home   Savings Account (FHSA), introduced in 2023, for this purpose. Compare the key characteristics   of   these three options: (1) TFSA, (2) RRSP HBP, and   (3)   FHSA.   Which   option   do   you believe   is   the most   advantageous to this family, and what is your   justification for this choice? 
6.       Identify at least   five   risks   Michael   and   Sarah   face   and   evaluate   the   severity   and   frequency   of   each   risk identified. Propose appropriate risk mitigation strategies for each identified risk. 
7.       Using the expense approach,   calculate   life   insurance needs   for   Michael   and   Sarah   each.   Following is additional information needed to apply the expense approach. 
            They want to set aside CPP payments for emergencies   and retirement.   Thus,   exclude   survival/child CPP pension in your calculation. 
           Assume each will become financially independent in their retirement years. They are   expected to retire at age   65. 
           Hints: Use after-tax real discount rate. Expenses will increase, matching inflation. 
8.       Provide three recommendations with actionable   items   for Michael   and   Sarah   to   address   their   concerns or improve their financial   position.
            Use the analysis from the case study to support your recommendations.
